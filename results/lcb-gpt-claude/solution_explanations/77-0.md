# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
We have N books numbered 1 to N.
Book i assumes that you have read C_i books, the j-th of which is book P_{i,j}: you must read all these C_i books before reading book i.
Here, you can read all the books in some order.
You are trying to read the minimum number of books required to read book 1.
Print the numbers of the books you must read excluding book 1 in the order they should be read. Under this condition, the set of books to read is uniquely determined.
If there are multiple reading orders that satisfy the condition, you may print any of them.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
C_1 P_{1,1} \ldots P_{1,C_1}
C_2 P_{2,1} \ldots P_{2,C_2}
\vdots
C_N P_{N,1} \ldots P_{N,C_N}

Output

Print the numbers of the books you must read to read book 1 in the order they should be read, with spaces in between.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 0 \leq C_i < N
- \sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i \leq 2 \times 10^5
- C_1 \geq 1
- 1 \leq P_{i,j} \leq N
- P_{i,j} \neq P_{i,k} for 1 \leq j < k \leq C_i.
- It is possible to read all the books.

Sample Output 1

5 3 4 2

To read book 1, you must read books 2,3,4; to read book 2, you must read books 3,5; to read book 4, you must read book 5. To read books 3,5,6, you do not have to read any other books.
For example, if you read books 5,3,4,2 in this order, you can read book 1. This is a correct answer, because you will never be able to read book 1 with three or fewer books read. As another example, reading books 3,5,4,2 in this order also allows you to read book 1 with 4 books read.

# Example Case Handling

# ASSISTANT
Let's break down the given solution and identify the potential issues:

### Solution Logic
1. **Input Parsing:** The solution reads input and initializes an adjacency list `graph` and an `in_degree` list which counts the number of prerequisites for each book.

2. **Graph Construction:** For each book, the solution records in `graph` which books are unlocked by completing each prerequisite book, and it updates the `in_degree` of books that have prerequisites.

3. **Breadth-First Search Initialization:** The aim is to start from book 1 and determine the minimum set of prerequisite books to read before book 1. This is attempted using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach:
   - The `queue` is initialized with book 1 to start exploring all books that need to be read to eventually read book 1.

4. **Set of Books Needed:** The books to read are stored in the `books_needed` set. During exploration, the solution tries to identify all books needed using the adjacency relationships captured in `graph`.

5. **Topological Sort Attempt:** The solution uses a topological sort to determine the order in which books from the `books_needed` set are to be read. This is aimed at ensuring that no book is read before its prerequisites.

6. **Output:** It finally prints the books in the order determined by the topological sort.

### Issues in the Solution
- **Flawed Logic in Book Exploration:** The BFS starting from book 1 tries to use `graph`, which was built in reverse order (each prerequisite points to the book it unlocks), to gather prerequisites. Given that we're starting at book 1, this logic doesn't effectively trace back to gather all necessary prerequisite books.
  
- **Improper Use of `in_degree`:** During the BFS step, only books that have an `in_degree` of 0 are considered, but this process should typically start from books that have no prerequisites, which doesn't require starting directly with book 1 as is done here.

- **Potential Missteps in Toposort Initialization:** It reuses and resets `in_degree` without redefining it correctly before computing in the topological sort, leading to potential miscalculations in dependencies.

- **Incorrect Book Queues:** The BFS enqueue logic appears flawed as it initializes from book 1, which doesn't align with how prerequisites should actually be processed. This could keep valid prerequisite books out of the queue.

### Categorization of Mistake
I would categorize this as a mistake that reflects misunderstood algorithmic intent:
- **2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make.** The function attempts to leverage a BFS followed by a topological sort to solve a dependency-resolution problem. The logical flaw stems from misinterpretations of how to effectively use these structures together to trace and order prerequisites correctly.

### Simulation of Sample Test Case 1

Given:
```
6
3 2 3 4
2 3 5
0
1 5
0
0
```
Expected Output for Sample Test 1:
```
5 3 4 2
```
**Here's what goes wrong:**
- The BFS starts at book 1 and doesn't correctly resolve books 5, 3, and necessary dependencies.
- The `books_needed` optimization with BFS and topological sort leads to incorrect ordering or missing elements due to the improper queue initialization and faulty in-degree calculations.

### Conclusion
The solution's approach is sound in theory (given the problem), but its implementation mistakes in using BFS and topological sort mean it fails to correctly trace prerequisite books back effectively. This build-up of dependencies and their resolution order is crucial in correct algorithm design for scenarios like this.
