# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
You are given an integer N and strings R and C of length N consisting of A, B, and C. Solve the following problem.
There is a N \times N grid. All cells are initially empty.
You can write at most one character from A, B, and C in each cell. (You can also leave the cell empty.)
Determine if it is possible to satisfy all of the following conditions, and if it is possible, print one way to do so.

- Each row and each column contain exactly one A, one B, and one C.
- The leftmost character written in the i-th row matches the i-th character of R.
- The topmost character written in the i-th column matches the i-th character of C.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
R
C

Output

If there is no way to fill the grid to satisfy the conditions in the problem statement, print No in one line.
Otherwise, print one such way to fill the grid in the following format:
Yes
A_1
A_2
\vdots
A_N

The first line should contain Yes.
The i-th of the subsequent N lines should contain a string A_i of length N.

- If the j-th character of A_i is ., it indicates that the cell in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is empty.
- If the j-th character of A_i is A, it indicates that A is written in the cell in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
- If the j-th character of A_i is B, it indicates that B is written in the cell in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.
- If the j-th character of A_i is C, it indicates that C is written in the cell in the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.

If there are multiple correct ways to fill the grid, you may print any of them.

Constraints


- N is an integer between 3 and 5, inclusive.
- R and C are strings of length N consisting of A, B, and C.

Sample Input 1

5
ABCBC
ACAAB

Sample Output 1

Yes
AC..B
.BA.C
C.BA.
BA.C.
..CBA

The grid in the output example satisfies all the following conditions, so it will be treated as correct.

- Each row contains exactly one A, one B, and one C.
- Each column contains exactly one A, one B, and one C.
- The leftmost characters written in the rows are A, B, C, B, C from top to bottom.
- The topmost characters written in the columns are A, C, A, A, B from left to right.

Sample Input 2

3
AAA
BBB

Sample Output 2

No

For this input, there is no way to fill the grid to satisfy the conditions.
## Solution
```py

    for row in grid:
        if sorted(row) != ['A', 'B', 'C']:
            return False
    for col in range(N):
        if sorted(grid[row][col] for row in range(N)) != ['A', 'B', 'C']:
            return False
    return True


def solve_grid(N, R, C):
    import itertools
    # All permutations of 'ABC'
    patterns = list(itertools.permutations('ABC'))

    for pattern_id in range(3, N):
        grid = [['.'] * N for _ in range(N)]

        # Fix leftmost column with R's letters
        for i in range(N):
            grid[i][0] = R[i]

        # Fix topmost row with C's letters
        for i in range(N):

        # Attempt using permutations to fill rows/cols
        for i in range(1, N):
            for char in 'ABC':
                if grid[i][0] == char:
                    continue
                if rows_left[char] > 0:
                    grid[i][0] = char
                    rows_left[char] -= 1
            
        for j in range(1, N):
            for char in 'ABC':
                if grid[0][j] == char:
                    continue
                if cols_left[char] > 0:
                    grid[0][j] = char
                    cols_left[char] -= 1            

        # Here we apply row & column scan to place ABC
        if is_possible(grid, N):
            print("Yes")
            for i in range(N):
                print(''.join(grid[i]))

# ASSISTANT
Let's walk through the given solution and analyze the provided code step-by-step to identify issues and simulate it on sample test cases.

### Code Explanation

1. **Functions:**
   - `is_possible(grid, N)`: This function checks if each row and column in the grid contains exactly one "A", "B", and "C".
   - `solve_grid(N, R, C)`: This is the main function that attempts to create a grid that satisfies the given conditions.

2. **Approach in `solve_grid`:**
   - It initializes some permutations of "ABC".
   - It generates an empty `N x N` grid filled with `'.'`.
   - It sets the leftmost character of each row according to `R` and the topmost character of each column according to `C`.
   - It then tries to place "A", "B", or "C" in the remaining positions using some conditions related to permutations but seems to miss filling the grid in a meaningful way.
   - It checks the validity of the grid using `is_possible` function.

3. **Issues Noticed:**
   - The solution doesnâ€™t correctly populate the grid with "A", "B", and "C" in a meaningful way. It attempts to use patterns but doesn't perform logical checks to ensure constraints are followed with permutations.
   - The `rows_left` and `cols_left` dictionaries are not updated or used correctly to fill the remaining cells with proper logic.
   - There is a misunderstanding in loop behavior where permutations and substitutions don't effectively solve the problem. 
   - The usage of `range(3, N)` in the main for-loop is incorrect as it skips some conditions.

### Simulation

#### Sample Input 1: 
```
N = 5
R = "ABCBC"
C = "ACAAB"
```

#### Expected Output:
```
Yes
AC..B
.BA.C
C.BA.
BA.C.
..CBA
```

#### Error in Execution:
The provided solution will not compute a valid solution because it does not effectively reposition "A", "B", "C" other than the first row and first column, and it uses inefficient and incorrect logic to check and place values. Thus, it will likely result in "No" without ever correctly populating the grid.

#### Sample Input 2:
```
N = 3
R = "AAA"
C = "BBB"
```

#### Expected Output:
```
No
```

#### Result:
This output should be correct, but mainly by coincidence because of the circular dependency issue in input constraints.

### Conclusion and Categorization

The logic in the code to solve the constraints of the problem is severely flawed, failing to correctly implement permutation checks and grid filling based on provided constraints:

- **Categorization:** 
   2) **Hard mistake that intelligent programmers can make:** 
   - The problem inherently involves intricate manipulation of permutations and character constraints across both dimensions of an NxN grid. The complexity arises in accurately understanding and implementing the constraints simultaneously on rows and columns which can be an oversight for even experienced programmers.
