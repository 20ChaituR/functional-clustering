# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
You are given two grids, A and B, each with H rows and W columns.
For each pair of integers (i, j) satisfying 1 \leq i \leq H and 1 \leq j \leq W, let (i, j) denote the cell in the i-th row and j-th column. In grid A, cell (i, j) contains the integer A_{i, j}. In grid B, cell (i, j) contains the integer B_{i, j}.
You will repeat the following operation any number of times, possibly zero. In each operation, you perform one of the following:

- Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq H-1 and swap the i-th and (i+1)-th rows in grid A.
- Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \leq i \leq W-1 and swap the i-th and (i+1)-th columns in grid A.

Determine whether it is possible to make grid A identical to grid B by repeating the above operation. If it is possible, print the minimum number of operations required to do so.
Here, grid A is identical to grid B if and only if, for all pairs of integers (i, j) satisfying 1 \leq i \leq H and 1 \leq j \leq W, the integer written in cell (i, j) of grid A is equal to the integer written in cell (i, j) of grid B.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H W
A_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} \cdots A_{1, W}
A_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} \cdots A_{2, W}
\vdots
A_{H, 1} A_{H, 2} \cdots A_{H, W}
B_{1, 1} B_{1, 2} \cdots B_{1, W}
B_{2, 1} B_{2, 2} \cdots B_{2, W}
\vdots
B_{H, 1} B_{H, 2} \cdots B_{H, W}

Output

If it is impossible to make grid A identical to grid B, output -1. Otherwise, print the minimum number of operations required to make grid A identical to grid B.

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 2 \leq H, W \leq 5
- 1 \leq A_{i, j}, B_{i, j} \leq 10^9

Sample Input 1

4 5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20

16 18 17 20 19

Sample Output 1

3

Swapping the fourth and fifth columns of the initial grid A yields the following grid:
1 2 3 5 4
6 7 8 10 9
11 12 13 15 14
16 17 18 20 19

Then, swapping the second and third rows yields the following grid:
1 2 3 5 4
11 12 13 15 14
6 7 8 10 9
16 17 18 20 19

Finally, swapping the second and third columns yields the following grid, which is identical to grid B:
1 3 2 5 4
11 13 12 15 14
6 8 7 10 9
16 18 17 20 19

You can make grid A identical to grid B with the three operations above and cannot do so with fewer operations, so print 3.

### Explanation of the Solution

The provided solution is intended to determine if it's possible to make grid A identical to grid B by swapping rows and columns. Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the solution does:

1. **Transpose Function:**
   - `transpose(matrix)` is a utility function that transposes a given matrix. It uses Python's `zip` to achieve this.

2. **Counting Rows and Columns:**
   - `count_elements(matrix)` is used to count occurrences of each row (or column, if transposed) within a matrix. It utilizes the `Counter` from the `collections` module which counts the appearance of each row in the form of tuples.

3. **Checking Row Permutations:**
   - The code computes `row_count_A` and `row_count_B`, which are counts of rows in grids A and B, respectively.
   - If these counts differ, print `-1` since it's impossible to rearrange rows in A to match B.

4. **Checking Column Permutations:**
   - The solution applies the same logic as rows to columns by transposing both matrices and counting occurrences. If column counts differ, it's impossible to rearrange columns in grid A to match B, and it returns `-1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution checks if both row and column counts match, indicating it's theoretically possible to reorder A into B. However, the solution omits calculating the exact number of operations to achieve the reorder. Instead, it directly returns `0` without attempting any swaps.

### Issue with the Solution

The solution is incomplete because it doesn't calculate the actual minimum number of operations required or even attempts any operation. It only verifies the possibility based on mathematical equivalence in terms of row and column occurrences.

### Categorization of the Error

Based on the explanation of the solution, this error can be categorized into:

2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make.

This is because the programmer correctly checks preconditions for possible swaps but fails to implement the necessary computations and logic to derive the minimum number of swapping operations needed. Moreover, the scope of operations is logical and involves mathematical permutations that could be challenging to implement correctly.

### Simulation of Running on Sample Test Cases

Let's simulate running the solution on the sample test case to verify the output:

- **Sample Input 1:**

```plaintext
4 5
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20
1 3 2 5 4
11 13 12 15 14
6 8 7 10 9
16 18 17 20 19
```

#### Analysis
- All rows in A can be reordered to match B using valid row swaps.
- Columns also match in a way that allows column swaps to reorder A to match B.

**Expected Output:** 3 (as explained in the problem)

**Simulated Output:** 0 (since the solution doesn't compute or perform swaps)

- **Sample Input 2:**

```plaintext
2 2
1 1
1 1
1 1
1 1000000000
```

#### Analysis
- It's impossible to swap any rows or columns to achieve B from A.

**Expected Output:** -1

**Simulated Output:** -1

- **Sample Input 3:**

```plaintext
3 3
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
```

**Expected Output:** 0 (since A is already identical to B)

**Simulated Output:** 0

- **Sample Input 4:**

Due to the solution's inherent flaw (not computing operations), it would return `0` mistakenly.

### Conclusion

The observed output shows that while the solution can detect impossibility scenarios correctly (-1), it fails to determine the minimum number of valid operations needed when possible, returning `0` mistakenly every time unless totally impossible. The mistake falls into category 2 due to the incomplete implementation logic.

# UPDATE
This is a dumb mistake. It didn't actually fully solve the problem.
