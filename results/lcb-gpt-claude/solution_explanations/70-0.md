I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
N players, player 1, player 2, ..., player N, participate in a game tournament. Just before the tournament starts, each player forms a one-person team, so there are N teams in total.
The tournament has a total of N-1 matches. In each match, two different teams are chosen. One team goes first, and the other goes second. Each match will result in exactly one team winning. Specifically, for each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N-1, the i-th match proceeds as follows.

- The team with player p_i goes first, and the team with player q_i goes second.
- Let a and b be the numbers of players in the first and second teams, respectively. The first team wins with probability \frac{a}{a+b}, and the second team wins with probability \frac{b}{a+b}.
- Then, the two teams are combined into a single team.

The result of each match is independent of those of the others.
For each of the N players, print the expected number of times the team with that player wins throughout the tournament, modulo 998244353.
 How to print an expected value modulo 998244353
It can be proved that the sought expected value is always rational. Also, the constraints of this problem guarantee that if the sought expected value is expressed as an irreducible fraction \frac{y}{x}, then x is not divisible by 998244353. Now, there is a unique integer z between 0 and 998244352, inclusive, such that xz \equiv y \pmod{998244353}. Report this z.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
p_1 q_1
p_2 q_2
\vdots
p_{N-1} q_{N-1}

Output

For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, print E_i, the expected number, modulo 998244353, of times the team with player i wins throughout the tournament, separated by spaces, in the following format:
E_1 E_2 \ldots E_N

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \leq p_i, q_i \leq N
- Just before the i-th match, player p_i and player q_i belong to different teams.
- All input values are integers.

We call a team formed by player x_1, player x_2, \ldots, player x_k as team \lbrace x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k \rbrace.

- The first match is played by team \lbrace 1 \rbrace, with player 1, and team \lbrace 2 \rbrace, with player 2. Team \lbrace 1 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{1}{2}, and team \lbrace 2 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{1}{2}. Then, the two teams are combined into a single team \lbrace 1, 2 \rbrace.
- The second match is played by team \lbrace 4 \rbrace, with player 4, and team \lbrace 3 \rbrace, with player 3. Team \lbrace 4 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{1}{2}, and team \lbrace 3 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{1}{2}. Then, the two teams are combined into a single team \lbrace 3, 4 \rbrace.
- The third match is played by team \lbrace 5 \rbrace, with player 5, and team \lbrace 3, 4 \rbrace, with player 3. Team \lbrace 5 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{1}{3}, and team \lbrace 3, 4 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{2}{3}. Then, the two teams are combined into a single team \lbrace 3, 4, 5 \rbrace.
- The fourth match is played by team \lbrace 1, 2 \rbrace, with player 1, and team \lbrace 3, 4, 5 \rbrace, with player 4. Team \lbrace 1, 2 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{2}{5}, and team \lbrace 3, 4, 5 \rbrace wins with probability \frac{3}{5}. Then, the two teams are combined into a single team \lbrace 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \rbrace.

The expected numbers of times the teams with players 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 win throughout the tournament, E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, E_5, are \frac{9}{10}, \frac{9}{10}, \frac{53}{30}, \frac{53}{30}, \frac{14}{15}, respectively.

# ASSISTANT
Let's analyze the provided solution and how it attempts to solve the problem. We'll simulate the solution on the sample input to see where it might be going wrong and identify any errors in reasoning or implementation.

### Solution Explanation

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**: The solution uses a union-find (or disjoint-set) data structure to manage the teams throughout the tournament. Each player starts as their own team.

2. **Union Operation**: For each match `(p_i, q_i)`, it unites the two teams `p` and `q`. The root of the team that wins the match (probabilistically) will act as the representative of the combined team.

3. **Win Probability Calculation**: For each match, it calculates the probability of team `p` winning as `size_p / (size_p + size_q)`, and `q` winning as `size_q / (size_p + size_q)`.

4. **Tracking Expected Wins**: The solution maintains the expected win count for each player’s team. However, this is where the solution seems to deviate: it tries to add the win probability directly to the `expected_win_count` of the root of the non-dominant team's root after the union, which may not be correct because it doesn’t accumulate the wins properly.

5. **Final Calculation**: After processing all matches, it attempts to calculate each player's expected number of wins modulo a given number. It uses modular arithmetic (modular inverse) to express probable rational results in modular form.

### Simulating the Solution

Let’s simulate the solution with a focus on identifying where the problem might occur.

#### Key Observations
- **Incorrect Placement in Union**: The expected win contributions are miscalculated by adding `win_prob_x` to `expected_win_count[root_y]` instead of accumulating correctly while considering the win probability of the current match outcomes and rearranging correctly based on outcomes.
  
- **Expected Wins Interpretation**: After each union, the exact contribution to the expected win count needs to be correctly added proportionally to reflecting the probability of either the new representative of this union to be chosen or win based on this setup.

### Root Cause Identification

The root cause of the problem lies mainly in its incorrect handling of expected win counts. When uniting two teams, the net expected win count should reflect that both teams have participated in a match and their total wins should be adjusted as per match outcomes, discounting/excluding wins already counted by any prior probabilities.

### Categorization of Error

Based on the understanding:
1. **Hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make**: The primary logical error is a sophisticated bug in how the win probabilities are accumulated and transformed during union operations. It's a nuanced issue of improperly managing cumulative statistics over dynamically unioned sets.

This solution doesn't handle the nuanced way win expectations should be carried forward across matches and fails to adjust for effects correctly within a sequence of union-find operations. This isn't a simple syntax or logic mistake but rather a deeper design issue in handling expected values within a union-find-based structure. This detailed perspective compels category 2 as the appropriate choice.
