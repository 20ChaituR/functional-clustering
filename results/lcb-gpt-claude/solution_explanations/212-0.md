# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer $n$. On their turn, the player can add $1$ to the current integer or subtract $1$. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by $3$, then he wins. If $10$ moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.

Write a program that, based on the integer $n$, determines who will win if both players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.

The single line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$).

Output

For each test case, print "First" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "Second" without quotes if Vova wins.Sample Input 1:
6

1

3

5

100

999

1000



Sample Output 1:

First
Second
First
First
Second
First

## Solution
```py
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    # If the current number is divisible by 3, Vanya immediately wins.
    if n % 3 == 0:
        print("First")
    # If we can make it divisible by 3 in the next move
    else:
        print("First")
```
# ASSISTANT
Let's break down the given solution step by step and analyze what's happening with it.

### Solution Explanation

The solution reads an integer `t` from the input, which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.

The logic applied in the solution is:

1. If `n` is divisible by 3 (`n % 3 == 0`), it concludes that Vanya wins and outputs "First".
2. If `n` is not divisible by 3, it still concludes that Vanya wins and outputs "First".

### Analysis of the Solution

The solution seems to misunderstand the problem. The idea of the problem is that Vanya can win if he can make the number divisible by 3 on his turn at some point within 10 moves. If after 10 moves Vanya has not achieved this, Vova wins.

The crux of this misunderstanding is evident in the `else` block. The approach always outputs "First" regardless of the state of the game after checking if the number is initially divisible by 3. However, Vanya doesn't always win immediately. The optimal play might require Vanya or Vova to pass turns strategically.

### Simulating on Sample Test Cases

Let's simulate the given solution on the provided samples:

1. **n = 1**: The current solution prints "First".
   - Actual: Vanya can change 1 to 2, and then from 2 to 3, winning the game, which is correct.
   
2. **n = 3**: The current solution prints "First".
   - Actual: As 3 is already divisible by 3, Vanya wins, correct.
   
3. **n = 5**: The current solution prints "First".
   - Actual: Vanya can change 5 to 4, and then from 4 to 3 on the next turn, winning the game, which is correct.
   
4. **n = 100**: The current solution prints "First".
   - Actual: Vanya can move: 100 -> 101 -> 102, winning on the second move, correct.
   
5. **n = 999**: The current solution prints "First".
   - Actual: 999 is already divisible by 3, so Vanya wins immediately, correct.
   
6. **n = 1000**: The current solution prints "First".
   - Actual: Vanya can move 1000 -> 999, winning on the first move. Thus, the given output "First" is correct.

However, the simulation might yield problematic results for certain unexplored test cases due to the faulty logic design. For instance, if within 10 steps neither of the players make the number divisible by 3, Vova should win, which is a scenario not covered by the given solution.

### Categorization of the Mistake

The solution falls into the second category:
  
2) **Hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make**. 

This is because the solution incorrectly and simplistically assumes that Vanya always wins since it doesn't handle scenarios where after playing optimally the game might end with Vova's win after 10 moves. Even though in the given inputs the fallacy isn't exposed, intelligent programmers might overlook edge cases, or systematically forget to implement turn limits or two-player constraints, leading to this oversight.

# UPDATE
This is more of a dumb mistake (Category 1). This seems like just a typo. In this case, if n % 3 == 0, the model should respond with "Second" and otherwise, the model should respond with "First", but in both cases the model responds with "First".
