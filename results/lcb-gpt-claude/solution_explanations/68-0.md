I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
There are N roulette wheels.
The i-th (1\leq i\leq N) wheel has P _ i integers S _ {i,1},S _ {i,2},\ldots,S _ {i,P _ i} written on it, and you can play it once by paying C _ i yen.
When you play the i-th wheel once, an integer j between 1 and P _ i, inclusive, is chosen uniformly at random, and you earn S _ {i,j} points.
The points you earn from the wheels are determined independently of past results.
Takahashi wants to earn at least M points.
Takahashi will act to minimize the amount of money he pays before he earns at least M points.
After each play, he can choose which wheel to play next based on the previous results.
Find the expected amount of money Takahashi will pay before he earns at least M points.
More formal definition
Here is a more formal statement.
For a strategy that Takahashi can adopt in choosing which wheel to play, the expected amount of money E that he pays before he earns at least M points with that strategy is defined as follows.

- For a natural number X, let f(X) be the expected amount of money Takahashi pays before he earns at least M points or plays the wheels X times in total according to that strategy. Let E=\displaystyle\lim _ {X\to+\infty}f(X).

Under the conditions of this problem, it can be proved that \displaystyle\lim _ {X\to+\infty}f(X) is finite no matter what strategy Takahashi adopts.
Find the value of E when he adopts a strategy that minimizes E.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
C _ 1 P _ 1 S _ {1,1} S _ {1,2} \ldots S _ {1,P _ 1}
C _ 2 P _ 2 S _ {2,1} S _ {2,2} \ldots S _ {2,P _ 2}
\vdots
C _ N P _ N S _ {N,1} S _ {N,2} \ldots S _ {N,P _ N}

Output

Print the expected amount of money Takahashi will pay until he earns at least M points in a single line.
Your output will be considered correct when the relative or absolute error from the true value is at most 10 ^ {-5}.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 100
- 1\leq M\leq 100
- 1\leq C _ i\leq 10 ^ 4\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- 1\leq P _ i\leq 100\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- 0\leq S _ {i,j}\leq M\ (1\leq i\leq N,1\leq j\leq P _ i)
- \displaystyle\sum _ {j=1}^{P _ i}S _ {i,j}\gt0\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3 14
100 2 5 9
50 4 1 2 4 8
70 5 2 4 2 8 8

Sample Output 1

215.913355350494384765625

For instance, Takahashi can play the wheels as follows.

- Pay 50 yen to play roulette 2 and earn S _ {2,4}=8 points.
- Pay 50 yen to play roulette 2 and earn S _ {2,1}=1 point.
- Pay 100 yen to play roulette 1 and earn S _ {1,1}=5 points. He has earned a total of 8+1+5\geq14 points, so he quits playing.

In this case, he pays 200 yen before earning 14 points.
Your output will be considered correct when the relative or absolute error from the true value is at most 10 ^ {-5}, so outputs such as 215.9112 and 215.9155 would also be considered correct.

Sample Input 2

2 100
1 2 1 2
10 6 0 0 0 0 0 100

Sample Output 2

60

It is optimal to keep spinning roulette 2 until you get 100 points.

    input = sys.stdin.read

    def expected_cost_for_points(cost, probabilities, points_needed):
        dp = [float('inf')] * (points_needed + 1)
        dp[0] = 0.0

        S_i = list(map(int, data[index:index+P_i]))
        index += P_i

        wheels.append((C_i, S_i))

    # Use a dp array to store the minimum expected cost to achieve exactly i points
    dp = [float('inf')] * (M + 1)
    dp[0] = 0.0

    # Evaluate for each subproblem using the expected cost computations
    for i in range(1, M + 1):
        for cost, scores in wheels:
            P_i = len(scores)
            # Calculate expected cost to attempt to get more points
            temp_cost = expected_cost_for_points(cost, scores, i)
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], temp_cost)

    print(f'{dp[M]:.9f}')

# ASSISTANT
Let's break down what the given Python solution is attempting to do and identify why it might be incorrect.

### Solution Analysis

The goal is to determine the minimum expected amount of money Takahashi needs to pay to earn at least \( M \) points using the available roulette wheels. Each wheel comes with a certain cost to play and yields a set of points. We need to find a strategy that minimizes the cost of earning at least \( M \) points.

#### Key Points:

1. **Function `expected_cost_for_points`:** 
   - This function calculates the minimum expected cost to earn a specified number of points using a single wheel.
   - It sets up a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum expected cost to exactly earn \( i \) points.
   - It iteratively updates this `dp` array considering all possible outcomes of playing the wheel.

2. **Overall DP Array:**
   - A `dp` array is initialized to handle the minimum cost of achieving exactly each point total from 0 to \( M \).
   - It iterates over each point total \( i \) and computes the minimum cost using each wheel's expected cost for that point total.

3. **Hypothetical Correction:**
   - The program calculates the expected cost for each eventual point requirement using all wheels and updates the `dp` array accordingly.

### Flaws in the Current Solution

The main issue with this solution lies in how it uses the `expected_cost_for_points` output. Key mistakes or potential misunderstandings are:

- **Redundant Calculation:** The `expected_cost_for_points` method essentially calculates an outcome as if it were isolated, which may not directly apply efficiently or accurately to the multi-wheel context.
- **Excessive Complexity:** The attempt to compute DP iteratively across all wheels might introduce inefficiency and errors, particularly if rounding errors or improperly leveraged expectations occur.
- **Independence Assumption:** The solution assumes independence between various score combinations on wheels while updating DP, which can misalign with dependencies introduced by sequential wheel selection.

### Sample Case Simulation

Let's simulate using the provided solution logic, examining if expected costs align with the outlined target costs:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Direct observation yields: The solution constructs the cost outcomes by repeatedly accessing wheels in sequence, adjusting through min-cost cycles.
   - A lack of clarity in the overall code flow results in infeasible cycle check alignment.

2. **Example 2 and 3:**
   - Especially in more complex scenarios, a simplicity in cycle selection belies deeper underlying expected value threatsâ€”this isn't fully captured in verbose problem cases.

### Conclusion

The solution falls into:

**2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make**

Given the nested level of expected value calculations and iterative approximation cycles, this solution demonstrates both conceptual appeal and execution error. The underlying principles resonate, but cohesive application with precise DP management proves elusive. This stems largely from glancing absence in accounting for combined strategy repercussions across probabilistic facets.
