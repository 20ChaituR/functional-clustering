## Problem
There are N sellers and M buyers in an apple market.
The i-th seller may sell an apple for A_i yen or more (yen is the currency in Japan).
The i-th buyer may buy an apple for B_i yen or less.
Find the minimum integer X that satisfies the following condition.
Condition: The number of people who may sell an apple for X yen is greater than or equal to the number of people who may buy an apple for X yen.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 \ldots A_N
B_1 \ldots B_M

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N,M \leq 2\times 10^5
- 1\leq A_i,B_i \leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3 4
110 90 120
100 80 120 10000

Sample Output 1

110

Two sellers, the 1-st and 2-nd, may sell an apple for 110 yen; two buyers, the 3-rd and 4-th, may buy an apple for 110 yen.  Thus, 110 satisfies the condition.
Since an integer less than 110 does not satisfy the condition, this is the answer.

Sample Input 2

5 2
100000 100000 100000 100000 100000
100 200

Sample Output 2

201

Sample Input 3

3 2
100 100 100
80 120

Sample Output 3

100
## Solution
```py
def find_minimum_X(n, m, A, B):
    A.sort()
    B.sort()
    
    # Function to count sellers who can sell at X or more
    def count_sellers(X):
        # Use binary search to find the first index where A[idx] >= X
        # Thus sellers who can sell at X is len(A) - idx
        from bisect import bisect_left
        return n - bisect_left(A, X)

    # Function to count buyers who can buy at X or less
    def count_buyers(X):
        # Use binary search to find the first index where B[idx] > X
        # Thus buyers who can buy at X is idx
        from bisect import bisect_right
        return bisect_right(B, X)

    # Binary Search to find the minimum X
    left, right = min(A), max(B) + 1
    answer = left

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        num_sellers = count_sellers(mid)
        num_buyers = count_buyers(mid)

        if num_sellers >= num_buyers:
            answer = mid
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    return answer

# Example usage
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().strip().split()
N = int(data[0])
M = int(data[1])
A = list(map(int, data[2:2+N]))
B = list(map(int, data[2+N:2+N+M]))

result = find_minimum_X(N, M, A, B)
print(result)

# ASSISTANT
Let's examine what this solution intends to do, step by step.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to find the minimum integer \( X \) such that the number of sellers who can sell for \( X \) yen or more is greater than or equal to the number of buyers who can buy for \( X \) yen or less.

### Solution Walkthrough
The provided solution performs the following steps:

1. **Sort Lists**: It first sorts the list of sellers' prices, \( A \), and buyers' prices, \( B \).

2. **Functions to Count Eligible Sellers and Buyers**:
   - `count_sellers(X)`: This function uses binary search to count how many sellers can sell an apple for at least \( X \) yen.
   - `count_buyers(X)`: This function uses binary search to count how many buyers can buy an apple for at most \( X \) yen.

3. **Binary Search for Minimum X**:
   - The main logic uses binary search over the possible values of \( X \), trying to find the minimum \( X \) such that the condition is satisfied.
   - **Left and Right Boundary**: The binary search initializes with `left` being the minimum value in \( A \) (minimum seller price), and `right` being the maximum value in \( B \) plus one (ensuring we encompass all buyer prices).

4. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Calculate `mid`, the middle point between `left` and `right`.
   - Determine `num_sellers` (sellers at or above `mid`) and `num_buyers` (buyers at or below `mid`).
   - If the number of eligible sellers is greater than or equal to the number of eligible buyers, update `answer` and search in the lower half (`right = mid - 1`).
   - Otherwise, continue the search in the upper half (`left = mid + 1`).

### Flaw in the Solution
Let's look at a flaw in the binary search boundaries or logic:
- **Boundary Misalignment**: The right boundary should ensure coverage of all meaningful \( X \) values, which is correctly set as `max(B) + 1`. However, the initial `left` boundary is set as `min(A)`. This may not always explore values below the minimum seller price accurately, particularly if all sellers have higher minimum prices than some of the high buyer prices.

### Error Analysis on Sample Cases
Let's simulate the solution on given test cases:

1. **Sample Input 1**: 
   - Sellers: `[110, 90, 120]`, Buyers: `[100, 80, 120, 10000]`.
   - Misalignment occurs as this input will incorrectly calculate mid points without properly resolving when equal `X` spans sellers and buyers exactly. More importantly, it may declare an incorrect initial mid-point check.

2. **Sample Input 2**: 
   - Sellers: `[100000, 100000, 100000, 100000, 100000]`, Buyers: `[100, 200]`.
   - Due to the misaligned `left`, it will not consider values between the minimum seller price and maximum buyer price directly in its upper threshold calculation.

3. **Sample Input 3**:
   - Sellers: `[100, 100, 100]`, Buyers: `[80, 120]`.
   - While seems to work here since all minimum prices are forced upon the logic directionally due to simple list nature, the logic doesn't fit more complex or broad value distributions.

### Categorization of Mistake

The mistake primarily lies in setting inappropriate boundaries for the binary search that do not adequately explore potential values, particularly when they span overlapping seller and buyer price ranges that are misaligned initially due to exclusion from search right off the bat.

The solution demonstrates a **"Hard mistake that an intelligent program can make"** due to the subtlety in the actual wide-range search configuration and its implications on test outcomes from initial constrained search boundaries.

# UPDATE
Seems like a bug. The idea of binary searching is correct, but it's likely there's an off by one error somewhere.
