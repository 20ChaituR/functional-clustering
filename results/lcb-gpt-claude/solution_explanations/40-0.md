# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
N people numbered 1 through N tossed a coin several times.  We know that person i's tosses resulted in A_i heads and B_i tails.
Person i's success rate of the tosses is defined by \displaystyle\frac{A_i}{A_i+B_i}.  Sort people 1,\ldots,N in descending order of their success rates, with ties broken in ascending order of their assigned numbers.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 B_1
\vdots
A_N B_N

Output

Print the numbers of people 1,\ldots,N in descending order of their success rates, with ties broken in ascending order of their assigned numbers.

Constraints


- 2\leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
- 0\leq A_i, B_i\leq 10^9
- A_i+B_i \geq 1
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3
1 3
3 1
2 2

Sample Output 1

2 3 1

Person 1's success rate is 0.25, person 2's is 0.75, and person 3's is 0.5.
Sort them in descending order of their success rates to obtain the order in Sample Output.

Sample Input 2

2
1 3
2 6

Sample Output 2

1 2

Note that person 1 and 2 should be printed in ascending order of their numbers, as they have the same success rates.

Sample Input 3

4
999999999 1000000000
333333333 999999999
1000000000 999999997
999999998 1000000000

Sample Output 3

3 1 4 2
## Solution
```py
def sort_people_by_success_rate(people):
    # Create a list of tuples in the form of (-success_rate, index) to sort them
    # Compute the key as the tuple (-(A_i / (A_i + B_i)), index) to correctly sort
    people_with_rates = [(-(A / (A + B)), i) for i, (A, B) in enumerate(people, start=1)]
    # Sorts by success_rate DESC due to negative sign, then index ASC naturally
    people_with_rates.sort()  # Python's sort is stable which helps here too
    
    # Extract and return only the indices, in the sorted order
    return [index for _, index in people_with_rates]

# Read the input
n = int(input().strip())
people_information = [tuple(map(int, input().strip().split())) for _ in range(n)]
# Calculate sorted indices
result_indices = sort_people_by_success_rate(people_information)
# Print the result indices as required
print(' '.join(map(str, result_indices)))
```
# ASSISTANT
Let's analyze the provided solution and explain its approach:

### What the Solution is Doing:

1. **Input Parsing:** The code begins by reading the number of people `N` and then reads `N` pairs of integers, each representing a person's number of heads `A_i` and tails `B_i`.

2. **Create a Sort Key:**
   - The `people_with_rates` list is created using a list comprehension where each person is represented as a tuple: `(-(A / (A + B)), i)`.
   - This tuple consists of:
     - The negative of the success rate `-(A / (A + B))`: This is used so that when sorted in ascending order by Python's default, it effectively sorts the people by descending order of success rate.
     - The index `i` (person number, starting from 1): This is included to handle ties by sorting in ascending order of their index automatically since Python's sort is stable.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `people_with_rates` is sorted. By sorting based on the computed tuple key, it ensures people are ordered by descending success rate, resolving ties by ascending index.
   
4. **Return Sorted Indexes:**
   - Finally, the sorted indices (person numbers) are extracted and printed in the required order.

### Simulation on Sample Test Cases:

Let's consider the provided sample inputs to see what the solution does.

**Sample Input 1:**

```
3
1 3
3 1
2 2
```

- Success rates are calculated as:
  - Person 1: `1 / (1+3) = 0.25`
  - Person 2: `3 / (3+1) = 0.75`
  - Person 3: `2 / (2+2) = 0.5`

- These are sorted as: 2 (0.75) > 3 (0.5) > 1 (0.25).

**Sample Input 2:**

```
2
1 3
2 6
```

- Success rates are:
  - Person 1: `1 / (1+3) = 0.25`
  - Person 2: `2 / (2+6) = 0.25`

- The rates are the same, so it sorts by person number: 1 < 2.

**Sample Input 3:**

```
4
999999999 1000000000
333333333 999999999
1000000000 999999997
999999998 1000000000
```

- Calculated success rates are:
  - Person 1: `999999999 / 1999999999 ≈ 0.50000000025`
  - Person 2: `333333333 / 1333333332 ≈ 0.25000000025`
  - Person 3: `1000000000 / 1999999997 ≈ 0.50000000050`
  - Person 4: `999999998 / 1999999998 = 0.499999999`

- Sorted order: Person 3, 1, 4, 2 based on success rates descending and index ascending when tied.

### Categorize the Mistake:

Upon reviewing the solution, everything seems to be working as intended. The function correctly parses input, computes success rates with ties resolved by the person number, and outputs the expected results.

Thus, this solution does not appear to have an error according to the provided problem description and constraints. If you have identified a specific error or scenario where it fails, that context would be necessary to further analyze it. However, given the details provided, this solution aligns with the problem's requirements. If there was a mistake, it might be seen as more of an oversight due to confusions about floating-point precision or implementation details, making it closer to a "hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make" in complex numeric contexts. However, without a specific error case, it's not possible to classify it conclusively.

# UPDATE
This solution is incorrect. Not sure what category to put it in, but seems like **2. Hard mistake** is best. The reason it's incorrect is because of floating point arithmetic. Two very large numbers being divided may cause some amount of floating point error, causing two equivalent fractions to be different. (e.g. 2/7 may have a different result than 104/364, even though they're the same number). This is a bug because the algorithm is correct.
