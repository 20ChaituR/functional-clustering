## Problem
Takahashi is playing a game.
The game consists of N stages numbered 1,2,\ldots,N. Initially, only stage 1 can be played.
For each stage i ( 1\leq i \leq N-1 ) that can be played, you can perform one of the following two actions at stage i:

- Spend A_i seconds to clear stage i. This allows you to play stage i+1.
- Spend B_i seconds to clear stage i. This allows you to play stage X_i.

Ignoring the times other than the time spent to clear the stages, how many seconds will it take at the minimum to be able to play stage N?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 B_1 X_1
A_2 B_2 X_2
\vdots
A_{N-1} B_{N-1} X_{N-1}

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
- 1 \leq A_i, B_i \leq 10^9
- 1 \leq X_i \leq N
- All input values are integers.

5
100 200 3
50 10 1
100 200 5
150 1 2

350

By acting as follows, you will be allowed to play stage 5 in 350 seconds.

- Spend 100 seconds to clear stage 1, which allows you to play stage 2.
- Spend 50 seconds to clear stage 2, which allows you to play stage 3.
- Spend 200 seconds to clear stage 3, which allows you to play stage 5.

## Solution
```py
def minimum_time_to_play_stage_n(N, stages):
    import sys
    
    INF = sys.maxsize
    # dp[i] is the minimum time to reach stage i
    dp = [INF] * (N + 1)
    dp[1] = 0  # It takes 0 time to be initially at stage 1

    for i in range(1, N):
        A_i, B_i, X_i = stages[i-1]
        
        # Option 1: Spend A_i to go to stage i + 1
        if i + 1 <= N:
            dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i + 1], dp[i] + A_i)
        
        # Option 2: Spend B_i to go to stage X_i
        if X_i <= N:
            dp[X_i] = min(dp[X_i], dp[i] + B_i)

    # The answer is the minimum time to reach stage N
    return dp[N]

import sys
input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

N = int(data[0])
stages = []

index = 1
for _ in range(N - 1):
    A = int(data[index])
    B = int(data[index + 1])
    X = int(data[index + 2])
    stages.append((A, B, X))
    index += 3

print(minimum_time_to_play_stage_n(N, stages))

# ASSISTANT
Let's analyze the provided Python solution for the problem.

### Problem Understanding and Solution Analysis

The problem entails a game consisting of \( N \) stages, where the objective is to find the minimum time required to reach the final stage \( N \). For each stage \( i \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq N-1 \)), there are two actions to move to the next playable stage:
- Spend \( A_i \) seconds to move to stage \( i+1 \).
- Spend \( B_i \) seconds to jump directly to an arbitrary stage \( X_i \).

The provided solution uses dynamic programming (DP) to calculate the minimum time needed to reach each stage. Here is a breakdown of what each part of the solution does:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the minimum time required to reach stage \( i \).
   - Initially, `dp[1]` is set to 0 because it takes zero seconds to start at stage 1.
   - All other entries in `dp` are set to infinity (`INF`) to represent unreachable states initially.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - For each stage \( i \) from 1 to \( N-1 \), the solution considers two options for progressing:
     - Move to stage \( i+1 \) with cost \( A_i \).
     - Jump to stage \( X_i \) with cost \( B_i \).
   - Updates the DP table by taking the minimum cost for reaching each stage.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The answer is stored in `dp[N]`, which represents the minimum time to reach the final stage \( N \).

### Evaluate the Solution on Test Cases

Let's simulate the solution on the given test cases:

#### Sample Input 1

```
5
100 200 3
50 10 1
100 200 5
150 1 2
```

**Calculation**:
- Start at stage 1 (\( dp[1] = 0 \)).
- From stage 1, spend 100 seconds to move to stage 2 (\( dp[2] = 100 \)).
- From stage 2, spend 50 seconds to move to stage 3 (\( dp[3] = 150 \)).
- From stage 3, spend 200 seconds to move to stage 5 (\( dp[5] = 350 \)).
- Result: `dp[5]` is 350.

The solution outputs 350, which matches the expected output.

#### Sample Input 2

```
10
1000 10 9
1000 10 10
1000 10 2
1000 10 3
1000 10 4
1000 10 5
1000 10 6
1000 10 7
1000 10 8
```

**Calculation**:
- Start at stage 1 (\( dp[1] = 0 \)).
- From stage 1, jump to stage 9 with cost 10 (\( dp[9] = 10 \)).
- From stage 9, jump to stage 10 with cost 10 (\( dp[10] = 20 \)).
- Result: `dp[10]` is 20.

The solution outputs 90, which is incorrect. This implies an issue with jumping logic, or the solution fails to update the minimum cost correctly.

### Categorization of the Error

Based on the simulation, the given solution is incorrect for some test cases. The major issue is that it appears to mishandle the optimal path via direct jumps due to incorrect cumulative updates or a logic flaw in maintaining the DP table over multiple updates. An intelligent programmer can overlook these logical issues, especially with minimum path algorithms where cumulative and parallel paths need careful updating to ensure optimality throughout each stage of the game.

Thus, I would categorize this bug under:

**2) Hard mistake that intelligent programmers can make.** 

The presence of alternative paths that fail to reconcile the costs correctly can be tricky to identify and debug without careful analysis, as shown in this test case.

# UPDATE
This is an algorithmic error. The dp only goes forward in stages, but it doesn't consider the case where it may be better to go back to a previous stage.
