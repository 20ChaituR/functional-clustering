# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
AtCoder Inc. sells T-shirts with its logo.
You are given Takahashi's schedule for N days as a string S of length N consisting of 0, 1, and 2.
Specifically, for an integer i satisfying 1\leq i\leq N,

- if the i-th character of S is 0, he has no plan scheduled for the i-th day;
- if the i-th character of S is 1, he plans to go out for a meal on the i-th day;
- if the i-th character of S is 2, he plans to attend a competitive programming event on the i-th day.

Takahashi has M plain T-shirts, all washed and ready to wear just before the first day.
In addition, to be able to satisfy the following conditions, he will buy several AtCoder logo T-shirts.

- On days he goes out for a meal, he will wear a plain or logo T-shirt.
- On days he attends a competitive programming event, he will wear a logo T-shirt.
- On days with no plans, he will not wear any T-shirts. Also, he will wash all T-shirts worn at that point. He can wear them again from the next day onwards.
- Once he wears a T-shirt, he cannot wear it again until he washes it.

Determine the minimum number of T-shirts he needs to buy to be able to wear appropriate T-shirts on all scheduled days during the N days. If he does not need to buy new T-shirts, print 0.
Assume that the purchased T-shirts are also washed and ready to use just before the first day.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
S

Output

Print the minimum number of T-shirts Takahashi needs to buy to be able to satisfy the conditions in the problem statement.
If he does not need to buy new T-shirts, print 0.

Constraints


- 1\leq M\leq N\leq 1000
- S is a string of length N consisting of 0, 1, and 2.
- N and M are integers.

Sample Input 1

6 1
112022

Sample Output 1

2

If Takahashi buys two logo T-shirts, he can wear T-shirts as follows:

- On the first day, he wears a logo T-shirt to go out for a meal.
- On the second day, he wears a plain T-shirt to go out for a meal.
- On the third day, he wears a logo T-shirt to attend a competitive programming event.
- On the fourth day, he has no plans, so he washes all the worn T-shirts. This allows him to reuse the T-shirts worn on the first, second, and third days.
- On the fifth day, he wears a logo T-shirt to attend a competitive programming event.
- On the sixth day, he wears a logo T-shirt to attend a competitive programming event.

If he buys one or fewer logo T-shirts, he cannot use T-shirts to meet the conditions no matter what. Hence, print 2.

Sample Input 2

3 1
222

Sample Output 2

3

Sample Input 3

2 1
01

Sample Output 3

0

He does not need to buy new T-shirts.
## Solution
```py
def min_new_tshirts_needed(N, M, S):
    plain_shirts = M
    logo_shirts = 0
    max_logo_shirts_needed = 0

    for plan in S:
        if plan == '2':  # Competitive programming event, needs a logo T-shirt
            if logo_shirts > 0:
                logo_shirts -= 1
            else:
                max_logo_shirts_needed += 1
        elif plan == '1':
            if plain_shirts > 0:
                plain_shirts -= 1
            else:
                if logo_shirts > 0:
                    logo_shirts -= 1
                else:
                    max_logo_shirts_needed += 1
        elif plan == '0':
            # No plan, he washes all shirts
            plain_shirts = M
            logo_shirts += max_logo_shirts_needed
            max_logo_shirts_needed = 0

    return max_logo_shirts_needed

# Sample usage
# Assuming we read from stdin:
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()
N = int(data[0])
M = int(data[1])
S = data[2]

print(min_new_tshirts_needed(N, M, S))
```
# ASSISTANT
Let's begin by stepping through the provided solution to understand its function, and then simulate it on some sample test cases.

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Initialization**:
   - `plain_shirts` is initialized to `M`, representing the number of plain T-shirts Takahashi has.
   - `logo_shirts` is initialized to `0`, meaning initially he has no logo T-shirts.
   - `max_logo_shirts_needed` keeps track of the maximum additional logo T-shirts Takahashi may need to purchase.

2. **Iterating through Schedule `S`**:
   - For each character `plan` in the schedule `S`:
     - If it's `'2'`: This day requires a logo T-shirt for a competitive programming event.
       - Use a logo T-shirt if available, otherwise increment `max_logo_shirts_needed`.
     - If it's `'1'`: This day can use either a plain or a logo T-shirt for going out.
       - Prefer a plain T-shirt if available; otherwise, use a logo T-shirt (if available); if nothing is available, increment `max_logo_shirts_needed`.
     - If it's `'0'`: No plans today. All worn T-shirts are washed and reset. `plain_shirts` is reset to `M`, and all used logo T-shirts (`max_logo_shirts_needed`) are added to `logo_shirts`, ready for future use.

3. **Result**:
   - The solution returns `max_logo_shirts_needed`, which is supposed to represent the minimum number of logo T-shirts Takahashi needs to buy.

### Observations and Running on Sample Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `N = 6`, `M = 1`, `S = "112022"`
   - Expected Output: `2`

   - Iterating: 
     - Day 1 (`1`): Use 1 plain shirt. Plain shirts left: `0`.
     - Day 2 (`1`): Use 1 logo shirt (since no plain available). Logo shirts needed: `1`.
     - Day 3 (`2`): Existing or new logo shirt used. Logo shirts needed: `2`.
     - Day 4 (`0`): Reset. Logo shirts increment `2` and plain shirts reset.
     - Day 5 (`2`): Use (theoretically previously washed) logo shirt. No need for new.
     - Day 6 (`2`): Use (theoretically previously washed) logo shirt. No need for new.

   - `max_logo_shirts_needed` ends at `2`, but this is incorrect because it assumes the theoretical wash in Day 4 works, which means we need `3` originally (as proven wrong in explanation).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `N = 3`, `M = 1`, `S = "222"`
   - Expected Output: `3`

   - Iterating:
     - Day 1 (`2`): Logo shirt used, need one more: `1`.
     - Day 2 (`2`): Second logo shirt: `2`.
     - Day 3 (`2`): Third logo shirt: `3`.

   - No mistake here, `max_logo_shirts_needed` is `3`.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `N = 2`, `M = 1`, `S = "01"`
   - Expected Output: `0`

   - Iterating:
     - Day 1 (`0`): Reset happens, but nothing was worn.
     - Day 2 (`1`): Use one plain shirt. No new shirts are needed.
   
   - Result is correct as `max_logo_shirts_needed` is `0`.

### Conclusion

The solution logic seems to have a flaw in its reset logic and how it handles the `max_logo_shirts_needed` during rewashes and between events requiring logo T-shirts that would be plausible only if pre-washed; thus suggests a potential edge-case issue.

### Categorization

The issue falls under:

**2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmer can make**: The approach sets the groundwork for tackling the problem methodically but the interaction between washing/reset cycles with further events that evolve leads to potential miscalculations. It's a subtly tricky interaction in the logic around cumulative counts and practical use before actual updates.

# UPDATE
`logo_shirts += max_logo_shirts_needed`

This line is the mistake. It should be equal not plus equal. That seems to be a hard mistake, so I agree.
