# USER
I will give you a competitive programming problem and a solution written in Python. I am certain the solution is incorrect. Can you explain what this solution is doing, then simulate running it on some sample test cases? Then, based on your reasoning, can you categorize the solution into one of these three categories?
   1) Dumb mistake that most humans will not make
   2) Hard mistake that an intelligent programmers can make
   3) The problem itself is truly ambiguous
## Problem
You are given two integers A and B, each between 0 and 9, inclusive.
Print any integer between 0 and 9, inclusive, that is not equal to A + B.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

Print any integer between 0 and 9, inclusive, that is not equal to A + B.

Constraints


- 0 \leq A \leq 9
- 0 \leq B \leq 9
- A + B \leq 9
- A and B are integers.

Sample Input 1

2 5

Sample Output 1

2

When A = 2, B = 5, we have A + B = 7. Thus, printing any of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 is correct.

Sample Input 2

0 0

Sample Output 2

9

Sample Input 3

7 1

Sample Output 3

4
## Solution
```py
# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read

# Parsing the input
A, B = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the sum
sum_ab = A + B

# Iterate over possible numbers from 0 to 9
# Print the first number that is not equal to the sum
for i in range(10):
    if i != sum_ab:
        print(i)
        break
```
# ASSISTANT
Let's analyze the provided solution for the given problem.

### Problem Understanding

You are given two integers \( A \) and \( B \), both ranging from 0 to 9, inclusive, and their sum is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 9. The task is to print any integer between 0 and 9 that is not equal to \( A + B \).

### Solution Explanation

The solution follows these steps:
1. It reads the input values \( A \) and \( B \).
2. It calculates the sum \( A + B \).
3. It iterates through numbers from 0 to 9.
4. For each number, it checks if the number is not equal to the sum \( A + B \).
5. It prints the first number it finds that is not equal to \( A + B \) and breaks the loop.

The logic of the solution is correct, as it ensures that it prints the first number that is not equal to \( A + B \).

### Simulation with Sample Test Cases

1. **Sample Input 1:**
   ```
   2 5
   ```
   - \( A + B = 2 + 5 = 7 \)
   - The loop checks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. The first number not equal to 7 is 0.
   - Output: `0`

2. **Sample Input 2:**
   ```
   0 0
   ```
   - \( A + B = 0 + 0 = 0 \)
   - The loop checks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The first number not equal to 0 is 1.
   - Output: `1`

3. **Sample Input 3:**
   ```
   7 1
   ```
   - \( A + B = 7 + 1 = 8 \)
   - The loop checks 0 to 7, and the first number not equal to 8 is 0.
   - Output: `0`

### Conclusion

The solution is correct as per the problem requirements. It efficiently finds a number from 0 to 9 that does not equal to \( A + B \). However, the solution printed specific sample outputs which are correct but do not affect the correctness of the overall solution, as any number except the sum is valid.

The assertion that the solution is incorrect seems to be a misunderstanding, as the solution does indeed work for the provided problem statement.

### Categorization

Considering the analysis, the given solution does not belong to any of the mistaken categories:

- There aren't any dumb mistakes in the code.
- There are no complex or hard mistakes in the code.
- The problem is not ambiguous.

The solution given is indeed correct for the presented problem statement.
